       "The dodo, scientifically known as *Raphus cucullatus*, was a flightless bird that lived on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It is often referenced as a symbol of extinction due to human activity.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Physical Appearance:** The dodo had a large, stout body, a tuft of curly feathers on its rear, a large hooked beak, and relatively small, stubby wings. It stood about 1 meter (3.3 feet) tall and weighed approximately 10-18 kilograms (22-39 pounds).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Habitat:** Native to Mauritius, the dodo thrived in the island's forests, where it nested on the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Diet:** It was an omnivore, primarily feeding on fruits, seeds, nuts, and possibly small land vertebrates and marine animals.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Extinction:** The dodo became extinct in the late 17th century, largely due to human activities such as hunting and the introduction of invasive species (like rats, pigs, and monkeys) that preyed on dodo eggs and competed for food sources. The last widely accepted sighting was in 1662, making it one of the first recorded instances of extinction caused by humans.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Cultural Impact:** The dodo has become a cultural icon representing the loss of biodiversity and the consequences of human impact on nature. Phrases like \"dead as a dodo\" emphasize its extinction and signify outdated or obsolete concepts.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the dodo was a unique bird whose extinction highlights the importance of conservation efforts for vulnerable species today. Its story serves as a cautionary tale about the fragility of ecosystems."
